# drinkCounter
Counter that writes to a txt file about the amount of beverages a friend as consumed on a daily basis.
It has two files paths, one for my desktop and another for my laptop so that the program can be run on both.
It creates a .txt file in one of the two files paths (dependant on which device the user selects) and writes to it the following: system date, amount of drinks consumed. New entries are added to the same .txt file in a new line format.
